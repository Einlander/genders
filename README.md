# genders
A JSON file with some genders in it.

### What is this for?
Anything that requires an incomplete but useful set of genders! 

### My gender is missing!
Sorry! Contact me and we'll talk about it! It may end up in the file!

### X and Y genders seem redundant.
One of the simple principles that I'm using to guide me for this is that user choice and flexibility is more important than being concise.
