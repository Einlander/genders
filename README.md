# genders
A JSON file with some genders in it.

### What is this for?
Anything that requires an incomplete but useful set of genders! 

####How do I contribute?
Submit an issue, fork the repo, make a pull request, @ me on [twitter @satsukitv](http://twitter.com/satsukitv), [email me](mailto:me@satsuki.tv), or subtweet [@pepitosfriend](http://twitter.com/pepitosfriend)

####You missed a gender!
I'm sorry! I make mistakes. If you want a gender to be included in this library, let me know.

####Some genders seem redundant
One of the simple principles that I'm using to guide this project is user choice and flexibility are more important than being concise. You're not required to use all the genders in this repository if you choose to use it, but please consider the multitude of gender expressions before limiting gender options to 2, 3, or 4 genders.
